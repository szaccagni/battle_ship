# Game Description
In this version of Battleship, you will play with an automated opponent. First you will set your board by dragging and dropping five ships of varying size on a ten by ten grid. Once a ship is dragged onto the board you can change its direction by clicking the ship. After you have placed all your ships you will click the 'Ready To Play' button and gameplay will commence. Your opponent’s board will appear and when it is your turn you can attack by clicking a square on their board. Hits will be displayed as red, and misses will display white. Once you sink an opponent’s ship the hits will change to the color of the ship that you sunk. Once either opponent has sunk all five of the opposing players ships, the game ends. At any point you can begin a new game by clicking 'Reset The Game' in the upper left hand corner of the screen.
